# 5. Known Issues

## 5.1. OG Tags are generated but not reflected on social platforms
All tags are properly included in the `<head>` section, but social platforms fail to detect them.

## 5.2. Locale detection fails when accessing URLs with empty locale, redirecting to 404 page

## 5.3. Occasional issue where only partial Notion database is fetched when routing through CategoryTree
This appears to be related to ISR caching.

## 5.4. Social images are not displayed on serverless platforms like Vercel
This occurs because the system generates image files directly using Puppeteer, which requires a server environment.
